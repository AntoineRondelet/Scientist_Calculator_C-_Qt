# Scientist calculator using polish reverse notation

---

This Scientist calculator was carried out as part of an object oriented course in my University.
I though the architecture of the project and then implemented it using Qt.

Feel free to have look to the code. Don't hesitate to give me your feedback and improve the calculator if you feel to do it.
